ииииииии 1ppv7 attachable wings! ииииииии

Includes:

и complete set of feathery wing animations (ZW)

ELVES ONLY.

* * *

This installer contains the following components:

1.INSTALL CORE FILES

This will install the animations needed to display the wings.

2.INSTALL TEST ITEMS

This will install a simple item to try them on (: The item comes complete with inventory, carried, and ground icons.

* * *

How to get them:

Add the item WINGS01.ITM to your inventory either by editing your savegame or the CLUA Console. Equip it.

* * *

What this is:

This is a mod to add attachable wings to your game. They are an equipped item (such as a sword) and thus do not modify any animation slot whatsoever. They have the identifier 'ZW'.

What this is not:

In its current form this implementation is not perfect. There are a few limitations concerned with using them. These are:

и Elves only
The supplied item is only usable by elves. If you circumvent this, you'll be dismayed to find out they do not display for non-elves. In fact, they will crash your game.

и Do not mix with

~Swooshy robes
(I highly discourage putting these on a character who will wear robes with a cloak. If you know basic anatomy, you'll see why this makes sense. It will look very odd)

~Shields, bows and weapons in your left hand
(This will not crash your game, but these three will look glitched. Conversely, two handed swords, halberds, staves, etc. work fine. Crossbows have a minor issue on the paperdoll but otherwise are fine as well.)
